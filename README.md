## Description <a id="description"></a>

A command-line application that makes use of inquirer and MySQL to manage and interact with a company database consisting of a table of departments, a table of roles, and a table of employees.

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

Clone this repository to your local system, then navigate into the local directory where you cloned it and type "npm install" in the terminal to acquire its require dependencies. Next, open index.js in VS Code (or your IDE of choice) and enter your local SQL password in the quotation marks after the password key on line 11. Finally, open the mysql terminal (mysql -u root -p in your terminal) in the local directory for the application and type "source db/schema.sql" to initialize the database used for this app (if you wish to seed the database with my provided sample values, type "source db/seeds.sql" before closing the mysql terminal).
